## Adding content

### New experience
Create a file in `src/content/experiences/` with this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
role: "Your Role"
company: "Company Name"
duration: "Jan 2025 – Present"
startDate: "2025-01-01"
description: "What you did."
---
```

Experiences are sorted by `startDate` descending (most recent first).

### New project
Create a file in `src/content/projects/` with this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Project Name"
description: "What it does."
tech: "ROS 2 | C++ | Python"
github: "https://github.com/..."
image: "/assets/project-images/your-image.png"
featured: false        # set true to show in the alternating featured layout
liveUrl: ""            # optional — link to a live demo
---
```

- `featured: false` → appears in the "Other Noteworthy Projects" card grid
- `featured: true` → appears in the full alternating image/text featured layout above the grid

### New blog post
Create a Markdown file in `src/content/blogs/` with this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: 2025-06-01
description: "One-line summary shown in listings."
tags: ["ROS 2", "SLAM"]
---

Your post content in Markdown...
```
