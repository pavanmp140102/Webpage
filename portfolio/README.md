## 📝 Content Management

All content is stored as markdown files in `src/content/`. This makes the portfolio **easy to maintain and update without touching component code**.

### Adding an Experience

Create a new file in `src/content/experiences/` (e.g., `my-internship.md`):

```yaml
---
role: "Software Engineer Intern"
company: "Tech Company"
duration: "Jan 2024 – Jun 2024"
description: "Brief description of your role and accomplishments."
---
```

**File naming:** Use kebab-case (`my-internship.md`, `summer-2024.md`)

### Adding a Project

Projects are displayed in two formats depending on the `featured` flag:

**Featured projects** (`featured: true`) — rendered as large showcase cards with a hero image, alternating left/right layout, and an overlay effect. Require an `image` field pointing to a file in `public/assets/project-images/`.

**Other/Noteworthy projects** (`featured: false`) — rendered as small cards in a 3-column grid with a folder icon. No image is shown; the `image` field is ignored and can be omitted.

Create a new file in `src/content/projects/` (e.g., `robot-navigation.md`):

```yaml
---
title: "Autonomous Navigation Robot"
description: "Detailed description of the project and its impact."
tech: "ROS2 | Python | LiDAR"
github: "https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name"
featured: true                                      # false = card grid, no image needed
image: "/assets/project-images/robot.png"           # only required when featured: true
# liveUrl: "https://example.com"                    # optional for both types
---
```

**Image path:** Store PNG/SVG files in `public/assets/project-images/` and reference them in the `image` field. Only needed for featured projects.

### Adding a Blog Post

Create a new file in `src/content/blogs/` (e.g., `ros2-guide.md`):

```yaml
---
title: "Getting Started with ROS2"
date: 2026-05-25
description: "A beginner's guide to ROS2 and autonomous systems."
tags: ["ros2", "robotics", "tutorial"]
---

**Important:** The `date` field must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Blog posts are automatically sorted by date (newest first).

Check `src/components/Navbar.astro`, `src/sections/Hero.astro`, and `src/sections/Contact.astro` for personal details to update.

### Theme & Styling

- **Colors & spacing:** Edit `src/styles/global.css` (CSS variables at the top)

- **All sections:** Use Tailwind classes in `.astro` files

## 🚀 Deployment

### GitHub Pages

A GitHub Actions workflow is included (`.github/workflows/deploy-portfolio.yml`) to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages on every push.

**Setup:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Workflow automatically builds and deploys to `gh-pages` branch
3. Portfolio appears at `https://yourusername.github.io/Webpage`

**Manual deployment:**
